+## TFSA-2020-001: Segmentation fault when converting a Python string to `tf.float16`
+
+### CVE Number
+
+CVE-2020-5215
+
+### Issue Description
+
+Converting a string (from Python) to a `tf.float16` value results in a
+segmentation fault in eager mode as the format checks for this use case are only
+in the graph mode.
+
+### Impact
+
+This issue can lead to denial of service in inference/training where a malicious
+attacker can send a data point which contains a string instead of a `tf.float16`
+value.
+
+Similar effects can be obtained by manipulating saved models and checkpoints
+whereby replacing a scalar `tf.float16` value with a scalar string will trigger
+this issue due to automatic conversions.
+
+This can be easily reproduced by `tf.constant("hello", tf.float16)`, if eager
+execution is enabled.
+
+### Vulnerable Versions
+
+TensorFlow 1.12.0, 1.12.1, 1.12.2, 1.12.3, 1.13.0, 1.13.1, 1.13.2, 1.14.0,
+1.15.0, 2.0.0.
+
+### Mitigation
+
+We have patched the vulnerability in GitHub commit
+[5ac1b9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5ac1b9e24ff6afc465756edf845d2e9660bd34bf).
+
+We are additionally releasing TensorFlow 1.15.1 and 2.0.1 with this
+vulnerability patched.
+
+TensorFlow 2.1.0 was released after we fixed the issue, thus it is not affected.
+
+We encourage users to switch to TensorFlow 1.15.1, 2.0.1 or 2.1.0.
