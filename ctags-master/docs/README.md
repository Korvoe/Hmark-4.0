## Rules for writing documents ##

To represent a backslash, surround it with double backquote. i.e. ``` ``\`` ```.
Escaping a backslash with another backslash doesn't work well depending
on the tools. When converting rst to man, two backslashes are converted
into one, however when converting to html, four backslashes are converted
into one.

The files in `man/` directory are generated from the man pages in `../man/`
directory. Do not edit the files in `man/` directory directly.
Execute the following command in the top directory to update them:

```sh
make -C man QUICK=1 update-docs
```
